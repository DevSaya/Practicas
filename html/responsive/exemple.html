            <h1>Academics</h1>
            <p>For more than a century, Simmons University has offered pioneering undergraduate and graduate programs that combine theory, practice, and real-world experience that will challenge you to see more broadly, think more deeply, and prepare you for leadership in the world.</p>

        <div class="div-body"><h2>The journey starts here</h2>
            <p>Located in the heart of Boston, Simmons is home to a respected women’s undergraduate program, as well as coeducational graduate programs in nursing and health sciences, liberal arts, business, communications, social work, public health, and library and information science.</p>
            <p>Simmons combines education for leadership in high-demand professional fields with the intellectual foundation of the liberal arts. The result is a Simmons graduate prepared not only to work, but to lead in professional, civic, and personal life — a vision of empowerment that Simmons calls preparation for life’s work.</p>
